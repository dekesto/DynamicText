So you want to contribute to DynamicText? That's great! Before you do though please read this all the way through,
it will explain what I'm looking for, and how I want code to be formatted (very important!).


What I'm looking for:

	I want code to be clean, organized, and most importantly work well with all the rest, if it causes 
	Something to break, fix it before submitting your code.

Code Formatting:

	Here is the most important part of DynamicText, the code, when you are beginning the process 	
	of cleaning up the code, format it like so:


	%hook NameOfHook

    	- (void)NameOfInstanceMethod { (Open bracket MUST be on the same line as your instance method)
    
        	Finished code has one blank line above and below at ALL times.
        	See how we keep the one blank line?
    
    	} (Closing bracket MUST be on the same indent as your instance method.


	%end


Your indents MUST be 4 spaces, no more, no less.
